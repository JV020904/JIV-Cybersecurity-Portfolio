Overview

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity projects developed as part of my formal training and independent practice. The projects demonstrate practical skills across security analysis, incident response, system hardening, automation, and documentation.

The focus of this portfolio is on defensive (Blue Team) cybersecurity, with an emphasis on analyzing security events, identifying risks, and implementing controls to protect systems and data.
