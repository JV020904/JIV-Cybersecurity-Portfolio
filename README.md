***Overview***

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity projects developed as part of my formal training and independent practice. The projects demonstrate practical skills across security analysis, incident response, system hardening, automation, and documentation.

The focus of this portfolio is on defensive (Blue Team) cybersecurity, with an emphasis on analyzing security events, identifying risks, and implementing controls to protect systems and data.


Through the projects in this portfolio, I demonstrate experience with:

  -Security Monitoring & Analysis

  -Incident Response

  -Access Control & System Hardening

  -Automation & Scripting

  -Database & Query Security

  -Risk Assessment

  -Technical Documentation

***Project Breakdown***
-SQL Security Analysis-

Folder: sql-filters-security/

Demonstrates the use of SQL queries to investigate:

  -Failed login attempts

  -Suspicious login activity by time, date, and location

  -Employee access filtering for security updates

-Linux File Permissions-

Folder: linux-file-permissions/

Explores Linux file and directory permissions to:

  -Review access controls

  -Modify file permissions securely

  -Understand permission impacts on system security


-Security Algorithms & Automation-

Folder: security-algorithms/

Contains Python-based security automation scripts, including:

  -Failed login detection from log files

  -File integrity monitoring using cryptographic hashes

  -IP-based access control logic

-Incident Response-

Folder: incident-response/

Includes an incident handler’s journal documenting:

  -Ransomware incidents

  -Network traffic analysis

  -Investigative thinking using real-world scenarios

-Vulnerability Assessment-

Folder: vulnerability-assessments/

A vulnerability assessment report aligned with:

  -NIST SP 800-30 risk assessment principles

  -Threat modeling and impact analysis

  -Practical remediation strategies



***Tools & Technologies***

Languages: Python, SQL

Operating Systems: Linux

Security Tools: Wireshark

Concepts: SIEM-style detection, access control, file integrity, risk analysis

Frameworks & Standards: NIST SP 800-30

***Purpose of This Portfolio***

This portfolio is intended to demonstrate:

-Practical, hands-on cybersecurity skills

-A defensive security mindset

-The ability to analyze, document, and respond to security issues

-Readiness for entry-level roles such as:

  -SOC Analyst

  -Cybersecurity Analyst

  -IT Security Analyst

  -Blue Team / Defensive Security roles

***Ongoing Developments***

This portfolio will continue to evolve as I:

  -Add more automation scripts
  -Gain more formal experience in the field

Expand incident investigations

Build larger security projects

Explore additional security tools and frameworks
