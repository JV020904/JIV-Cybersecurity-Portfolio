# IP Access Control Algorithm

#Date: September 23, 2025


## Description
This script demonstrates basic IP allow-list logic commonly used in firewalls,
network segmentation, and access control systems.

## How It Works
- Compares incoming IP addresses against a trusted allow-list
- Grants or denies access based on membership

## Why This Matters
IP filtering is often used to:
- Restrict administrative access
- Limit exposure of internal services
- Enforce network segmentation

## How to Run
```bash
python3 ip_access_checker.py
