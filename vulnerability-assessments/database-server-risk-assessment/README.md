# **Vulnerability Assessment Report**

## **1st January 20XX**

## ---

# **System Description**

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

# **Scope**

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

# **Purpose**

The database server is a centralized computer system that manages and stores large amounts of data. It is used to store customer, campaign, and analytic data. This data can be analyzed to track performance and personalize marketing efforts. This system must be made more secure due to how often it is used for marketing operations, and if it were disabled these operations would fail to be available which will negatively impact business. 

# **Risk Assessment**

| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Hacker* | *Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration* | *3* | *3* | *9* |
| *Employee* | *Disrupt critical operations* | *2* | *3* | *6* |
| *Customer* | *Change or delete any vital information* | *1* | *3* | *3* |

# **Approach**

The risks measured took account of the management and data storage procedures set in place by the business. Potential threat sources were determined utilizing the likelihood of a security incident given the open access permissions of the system. The severity of the respective potential incidents were determined by their potential impact on daily operational needs. 

# **Remediation Strategy**

Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls(RBAC), and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL is also relevant here. IP allow-listing should also be considered to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.
